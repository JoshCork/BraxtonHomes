# Prompt for Braxton Homes Website Clone

Copy and paste this prompt into a new session for the Braxton Homes project:

---

I need to clone a WordPress website to Next.js, similar to what we did for DrPaga. Here's what I need:

**Project Goal:**
Clone the existing WordPress website for Braxton Homes and convert it to a modern Next.js application with Tailwind CSS, ready for free hosting on Vercel.

**Website URL:** https://braxtonhomesaz.com

**Requirements:**
1. **Site Analysis**: Browse the WordPress site, identify all pages, extract content, images, and understand the layout structure
2. **Project Setup**: Initialize Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS (use Tailwind v3.4.1, not v4)
3. **Image Management**: Download all images from the WordPress site and organize them in `public/images/` with logical subdirectories
4. **Component Development**: Create reusable components (Header, Footer, and any site-specific components)
5. **Page Implementation**: Create all pages matching the WordPress site exactly in terms of content and layout
6. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS to match the WordPress theme design exactly
7. **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-first responsive design throughout
8. **Forms**: If there are contact forms, set up API routes (email integration can be added later)
9. **PDFs/Documents**: If there are downloadable files, download them and make links clickable
10. **Deployment Prep**: Set up `.gitignore`, README, and ensure it's ready for Vercel deployment

**Key Learnings from Previous Project:**
- Use browser automation tools to extract exact content and structure
- Download images early and organize them properly
- Create shared components for consistency
- Match WordPress content exactly (don't add placeholder content)
- Plan responsive breakpoints carefully
- Use Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 for compatibility

**Process to Follow:**
1. First, browse the site and take screenshots of all pages
2. Extract all content, images, and structure information
3. Set up the Next.js project with proper configuration
4. Download and organize all images
5. Create shared components
6. Build each page matching the WordPress site exactly
7. Test responsive design
8. Prepare for deployment

**Deliverables:**
- Complete Next.js application matching the WordPress site
- All images downloaded and organized
- All pages implemented with exact content
- Responsive design working on all screen sizes
- Ready for Vercel deployment
- Git repository initialized and ready to push

Please start by browsing the website and analyzing its structure, then proceed with the implementation following the same successful approach we used for DrPaga.
